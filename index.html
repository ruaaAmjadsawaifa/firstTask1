            Hello! My name is Rua' Amjad , and I am 23 years old. I was born in the holy city of Jerusalem and grew up in Hebron-Idhna. 
            I have always been passionate about technology, reading, and meditation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            I am currently studying Multimedia Technology at Hebron University in my graduation semester,
             and I have a good background in programming.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            In my free time, I enjoy reading books, meditating with my coffee and Fayroz music, and cooking. 
            I am also a firm believer in lifelong learning, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            I am excited to be part of this community and look forward to connecting with people who share similar interests and goals. What makes me special is my love for learning everything new and acquiring new skills, never stopping at a certain point.
             This is what motivated me to join this academy, 
            as I believe in the creativity of my field and its futureÂ potential.
